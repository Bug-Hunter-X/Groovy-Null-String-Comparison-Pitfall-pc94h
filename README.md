# Groovy Null String Comparison Pitfall

This example demonstrates a subtle issue related to null string comparisons in Groovy.

Groovy's dynamic typing allows for flexibility but can lead to unexpected results if not handled carefully.  In this scenario, a direct comparison with null may work as expected, but other implicit type conversions might not. This can lead to hard-to-debug issues in more complex code.
